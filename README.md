I decided to modify the example shown in class. I modified the motion of the tentacle by moving the pole and target in different ways, using the scripts provided. I did something similar with the wheel attach to an arm. I added the "SampleSinMover" script to the wheel and started moving it in the X axis. In this way, the arm and wheel produces a hilarious movement of a bug.

Finally, regarding the human I attached the script used for keeping track of the user's body. Concretely, it keeps tracks of the nose and the left and right extremities. Implementing that, it allows the user to control the human target and create their own movements.
